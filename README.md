RegelwerkTranslationBundle
==========================

# Merge and translate xliff files

RegelwerkTranslationBundle is a Symfony 2 bundle. It provides commands to merge/create XLIFF files from an XLIFF source
file, and a web interface for translations.

The web interface provides a two step process with translation and approval.

All translation and version information is stored in the XLIFF files.

**Highly unstable ATM!**
